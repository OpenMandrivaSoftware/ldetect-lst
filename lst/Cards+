# $Id$
# This is the database of card definitions used by XFdrake
#

# Each definition should have a NAME entry, a DRIVER
#
# A reference to another definition is made with SEE (already defined
# entries are not overridden).
#
# Optional entries are:
#
# NOCLOCKPROBE: advises never to probe clocks
# UNSUPPORTED: indicates card that is not yet properly supported by XFree4
# LINE: adds a line of text to be included in the Device section (can include options or comments).
#
# DRI_GLX: 3D acceleration configuration for XFree 4 using DRI.
# DRI_GLX_EXPERIMENTAL: DRI, but EXPERIMENTAL and may freeze the machine.
#
# BAD_FB_RESTORE: for bad cards not restoring cleanly framebuffer (XFree 4)
#
# MULTI_HEAD 2: for DualHead cards (think Matrox G450)
# MULTI_HEAD n: for n Head cards (eg: "MULTI_HEAD 4" for QuadHead)
# FB_TVOUT: the card displays to a plugged TV when in framebuffer
